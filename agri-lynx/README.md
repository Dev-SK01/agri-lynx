# AGRI LYNX
Agri Lynx aims to create a digital platform that connects farmers directly with local
markets, enabling real-time price discovery and transparent supply chain
management.The platform would allow farmers to track market prices, manage
inventory, and access fair pricing for their produce.This system would eliminate
intermediaries, reduce food waste, enhance logistics efficiency, and improve
market access for small-scale farmers, ultimately promoting sustainability and
economic fairness.
